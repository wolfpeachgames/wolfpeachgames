We are currently working on a 2D exploration game. You play as a raccoon who needs to explore the world and learn to communicate to all the other creatures in order to find your way! 🦝

Follow our progress on Twitter [@wolfpeachgames](https://twitter.com/WolfPeachGames) 🐦, Instagram [@wolfpeachgames](https://www.instagram.com/wolfpeachgames/) 📷, and on Itch.io [wolfpeach.itch.io](https://wolfpeach.itch.io) 🎮

💡 Fun Fact: The scientific name for a tomato 🍅 is *Lycopersicon esculentum* roughly translates to "edible wolf peach" 🐺🍑!
